##What is Static?
Static is an RTS game built on the Spout voxel engine. It is still in its very early stages of development.

##Core Ideas:
- _Gamepacks_
    + Gamepacks will be sets of files used to customize Static. The following are examples of things that may be included in gamepacks:
        * Unit models
        * Building models
        * Block textures (For landscapes)
        * Properties (of units, buildings, and blocks; cost, speed, attack, defense, etc)
        * Game rules (score, timelimit, gamemode, etc)
    + The Static default out-of-the-box gamepack will be space-themed.
    + Gamepacks will be used to allow normal non-developer users to easily create, customize, and share their own versions of Static.
    + Functionality that isn't customizable via gamepacks can be changed via plugins using the Static API.
